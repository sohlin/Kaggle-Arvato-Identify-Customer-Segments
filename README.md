# Kaggle-Arvato-Identify-Customer-Segments
Projects for Kaggle-Arvato: Identify Customer Segments

## Install
This project requires Python **3.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

+ NumPy
+ Pandas
+ matplotlib
+ scikit-learn
+ seaborn
+ xgboost
+ imblearn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer and not the Python 2.x installer.

## Code
Template code is provided in the /code/Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb notebook file.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Kaggle-Arvato-Identify-Customer-Segments/code/` and run one of the following commands:
```
ipython notebook customer_segments.ipynb
```
or
```
jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data
The data has been provided by Udacity and Arvato Financial Solutions. The dataset contains 4 data files and 2 description files. The description files have information about the features and their explanation. The 4 data files include:

+ Customer Segmentation
  + General Population demographics
  + Customer demographics
+ Customer Acquisition
  + Training data
  + Test data
  
Since the dataset is too large for uploading, no data is available here. But they can simply be found in the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Bertelsmann/Arvato Project Workspace as well as Kaggle.

## Results
The results have been clearly documented in the Jupyter Notebook and the report.
